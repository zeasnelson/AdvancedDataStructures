# AdvancedDataStructures

Implemented using Java

This project, created by Nelson Zeas, and Alex Salazar is an attempt to understand and observe the time complexity of three Data Structures. Which are AVL trees, Binary Search Trees, and Hash tables. Through empirical data sets and close analysis  will observe and document the overall performance and behavior of each structure at work.
