	Data Sets: Choose data on which to try your data structures and algorithms and collect empirical runtimes. While some data can be randomly generated, 
	you should be using some real sources as well. For example, take articles and parse out the words to get a word list.
	
	
	Alternatively, get data from a site such as this one: https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/ 
	Execution: Run your code on each set of this data, using random search terms.
	Tracking: the algorithms should be modified to keep track of actual clock time for a given run, as well as counting the number of operations required. 
	The track-worthy operations will likely include character and/or full-key comparisons. Then track in a chart the number of operations and actual clock 
	time.
	Analysis: discuss to what extent your empirical run time seems to agree with the theoretical runtime. If they differ, how do you account for that?
